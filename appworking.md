Once the team member finishes the task he will upload the document and it will come back to managers dashboard where he can review, re assign to team mate or send back to sales team. Then the sales person will download that document and send it for client approval in email (outside of this task manager). Once he gets the feedback sales person will upload the additional documents and comments in the same task and again send it to editor. This will go back and forth till the finall approved document is ready. Once the final document is ready the editor uploads that and send it to designers dashboard. The design manager will either handles himself or assign to team mate. The designer functionality is same as editor. once the creative is ready the designer will upload that and send to editorial for proof reading, if any mistakes are there again he will assign to designer will updated document and comments.
