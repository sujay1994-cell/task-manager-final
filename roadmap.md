# Task Manager App Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Architecture & Setup (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Project Planning & Requirements Finalization**:
   - Confirm all user requirements (task structure, workflows, UI design).
   - Define the tech stack (e.g., React.js for frontend, Node.js/Django for backend, MongoDB/PostgreSQL for database).
   - Set up project management tools for development (Jira, Trello, etc.).
   
2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Create the database structure to handle Brands, Editions, and Tasks.
   - Set up models for:
     - **Brands**: Create, delete, and list all brands.
     - **Editions**: Associated with specific brands, handle edition creation and deletion.
     - **Tasks**: Handle task creation, assignment, file uploads, and workflow statuses (In Progress, Awaiting Approval, Completed).
   
3. **Authentication & User Roles**:
   - Implement user authentication (managers and team members) with role-based access control (Sales, Editorial, Design).
   - Allow managers to assign and reassign tasks within their departments.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development & UI Design (Weeks 3-4)
1. **Basic UI Setup**:
   - Build a simple, user-friendly interface:
     - **Dashboard** for Sales, Editorial, and Design teams.
     - Ability to switch between brands and editions.
     - Create/edit/delete brands and editions.
   
2. **Task Management UI**:
   - Enable task creation with file uploads and assignment capabilities.
   - Task filtering based on department (Sales, Editorial, Design), status, and edition.
   
3. **File Upload & Storage**:
   - Integrate file uploads (support for audio, video, images, documents).
   - Store files securely (using Amazon S3, Google Cloud, etc.).

4. **Real-time Notifications**:
   - Implement notifications for task assignments, status updates, and rework requests.

## Phase 3: Task Workflow Implementation (Weeks 5-6)
1. **Task Status Flow**:
   - Implement the task lifecycle (Created > Assigned > In Progress > Awaiting Approval > Revisions > Completed).
   - Add functionality for team members to upload and submit work to their managers for approval.
   - Managers can review, reassign, or approve tasks.
   
2. **Version Control for Files**:
   - Implement version tracking for documents and media files.
   - Display file version history to track changes over time.

3. **Commenting & Feedback**:
   - Add a comment section for task-specific communication between departments (Sales, Editorial, Design).

## Phase 4: Final Workflow Polishing & Task Closure (Weeks 7-8)
1. **Task Finalization & Sales Approval**:
   - Enable the Sales team to close tasks after final approval from the client.
   - Ensure tasks can be reopened for corrections if necessary.

2. **Task Reporting**:
   - Add simple reporting tools to show completed tasks, tasks in progress, and deadlines.
   - Implement filters for tasks by Brand, Edition, Status, and Department.

3. **UI Refinement & Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize app performance for fast file uploads and smooth task navigation.
   - Polish the user interface for a minimal, clutter-free experience.

## Phase 5: Testing & Launch (Weeks 9-10)
1. **Quality Assurance Testing**:
   - Conduct end-to-end testing across all workflows (task creation, assignment, feedback, approval).
   - Test across different user roles (Sales, Editorial, Design) to ensure permissions and functionality are correct.

2. **Bug Fixing & UI Tweaks**:
   - Address any issues found during testing and refine the user experience.

3. **Launch & User Onboarding**:
   - Roll out the app to your team and conduct training or onboarding for all users.

## Phase 6: Post-Launch Enhancements (Ongoing)
1. **User Feedback & Iterations**:
   - Gather feedback from users post-launch to identify improvements.
   - Roll out minor updates or new features based on feedback.

2. **Additional Features**:
   - Consider adding integrations with other tools (e.g., email systems for sending feedback, cloud storage services).
   - Add further customization options like task templates for frequent task types (e.g., Profile, Cover, etc.).

### Estimated Timeframe:
- **Total Development Time**: 10 weeks for core functionality, with ongoing iterations based on feedback.
